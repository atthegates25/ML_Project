# House Prices in Ames, IA

In this project, we predicted home prices as part of an ongoing Kaggle data science competition. The project utilizes a unique dataset that includes a number of variables for each house sale. To structure the process, our team broke the project into the following broad stages: pre-processing/exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling stage, and finally an evaluation stage.
